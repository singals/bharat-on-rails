## How to contribute to Bharat

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/singals/bharat/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/singals/bharat/issues/new). 
Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, documentation or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

All the changes, including changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Bharat will be accepted

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [Issues](https://github.com/singals/bharat/issues), if it's accepted the story(ies) will be 
added to [Trello](https://trello.com/b/4TpMkaB4/bharat-story-board) and then you can start writing code.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Bharat in the [Issues](https://github.com/singals/bharat/issues).

#### **Do you want to contribute to the Bharat development?**

* Please have a look at [Trello](https://trello.com/b/4TpMkaB4/bharat-story-board) for backlog. Create an [issue](https://github.com/singals/bharat/issues/new) for any help you may need.
